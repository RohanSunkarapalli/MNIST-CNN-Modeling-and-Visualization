For this Project,
I've executed using google colab.
So, I've uploaded the project folder into my Google Drive and ran the notebook by importing the data which is present in my google drive. 
In order to run it locally make sure to include the data folder under the same directory where the notebook is present and 
also comment out first and third cells in the notebook. 
It can also be executed in google colab by importing the project folder into your drive and updating the path in the cells.
